### Discord bot base

## How to use?
You need to install node.js & npm, and have some basic knowledge about how to create a discord bot as i will not be giving a tutorial on creating a discord application.
And, that is it. You need to put your bot token in your config file, and the bot is ready to run. Remember to add it to your server, you silly.

## What are the bot functions?
The bot has one command, **/ping**. It responds with pong. That is it, as it is only a base for starting your bot.
Everything in the code is explained, so it is for newbies in this topic. Lower down i added some youtube links with tutorials how to setup your first discord bot.
